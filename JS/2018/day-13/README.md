A crop of this size requires significant logistics to transport produce, soil, fertilizer, and so on. The Elves are very busy pushing things around in carts on some kind of rudimentary system of tracks they've come up with.

Seeing as how cart-and-track systems don't appear in recorded history for another 1000 years, the Elves seem to be making this up as they go along. They haven't even figured out how to avoid collisions yet.

You map out the tracks (your puzzle input) and see where you can help.

Tracks consist of straight paths (| and -), curves (/ and \), and intersections (+). Curves connect exactly two perpendicular pieces of track; for example, this is a closed loop:

```sh
/----\
|    |
|    |
\----/
```
